Objective:

understand the difference between overload and overriding;
modeling the relationship "can do" with the ICloneable and IEquatable interfaces;
use dependency injection in the method technique;
use inheritance correctly;
understand DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), SoC (Separation of Concerns principles), Low Coupling principles;
write extensible testable code;
study design pattern Visitor.

1. To refactor the algorithm Task 2 Module 3 (don't use delegates and standard interfaces), allowing to sorting both in ascending and descending directions, depending on comparison criterion of the matrix rows. Develop unit-tests using varioгs comparison criterion of the matrix rows.

2. Develop a geometric shapes class hierarchy - Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle. Classes should describe the properties of a shape and have methods for calculating the area and perimeter of the shape. (A task with an emphasis on building an inheritance hierarchy, without unduly detailed implementation).

3. Create Polynomial class for working with polynomials of degree n > 0 of one real variable (as an internal structure for storing coefficients use the sz-array). Override the necessary methods of the System.Object Type and also overload base operations for working with polynomials. Develop unit-tests.
